Safe Cycling Map
================
Zoom in to see individual lanes, zoom out a little to see street safety.

Warning: This is an arbitrary rating system. Data is not guaranteed to be accurate.

This map uses OpenStreetMap data. It is not a complete or accurate map of the world and should not
be used in such a manner that deficiencies, omissions, inaccuracies or errors could result in death,
loss or injury. The maps are an iterative ongoing work-in-progress and everyone is welcome to
contribute editing the OpenStreetMap data if you spot inaccuracies. (warning courtesy of [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org/))

See the README at https://github.com/jakecoppinger/safe-cycling-map for how to fix the data (or
propose improvments to the safety rating system).
